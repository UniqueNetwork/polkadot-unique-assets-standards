# UAVM Extension Instructions

## Abstract

This document specifies the optional instructions of the [UAVM](./README.md).

## Instructions

### Additional Registers

The following registers are needed for the extension instructions in addition to the registers defined for the mandatory ones.

>NOTE: The registers are outlined only to indicate the data flow between instructions (i.e., how they influence each other). A chain's UAVM instance must ensure data flow, but the actual solution for it is implementation-defined.

| Register | Value Type | Default Value | Note |
|----------|------------|---------------|------|
| `MetadataUpdateMode` | `enum { Preserving, Replacing }` | `Preserving` | |

    /// This instruction may alter the behavior of the `UpdateSelectedAsset` instruction.
    /// - When the register is set to `Preserving`,
    ///   the behavior of the `UpdateSelectedAsset` isn't altered: it updates only the specified keys' values.
    /// - When the register is set to `Replacing`,
    ///   the "generally mutable" metadata keys are erased before the update is applied.
    ///
    /// NOTE: A key is considered "generally mutable" only
    /// if its application-level format explicitly states this.
