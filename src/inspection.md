# Unique Assets Inspection

## Abstract

As described in the [Polkadot Unique Assets Standards document](../../README.md), Unique Assets have attached data (the metadata).

This document specifies the transport-level metadata representation, the API for its retrieval, and the application-level formats.

## Specification

### Transport-level Metadata Format

The Transport-level Metadata Format describes how a Unique Asset's data should be communicated between a parachain and its client.

This document proposes to use the format defined for the [XCM Asset Metadata](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/RFCs/approved/0125-xcm-asset-metadata.html#explanation).

Hence, the metadata on the transport level is represented by a SCALE-encoded BTreeMap, where both keys and values are raw bytes.

```rust
type MetadataKey = Vec<u8>;
type MetadataValue = Vec<u8>;
type MetadataMap = BTreeMap<MetadataKey, MetadataValue>;
```

### Runtime API

A compliant chain must provide the following Runtime API to allow a client to fetch the metadata of a Unique Asset.

```rust
// The `MetadataQueryKind` and `MetadataResponseData`
// are the same as in the XCM Asset Metadata RFC.

type MetadataKeySet = BTreeSet<MetadataKey>;

enum MetadataQueryKind {
    /// Query metadata key set.
    KeySet,

    /// Query values of the specified keys.
    Values(MetadataKeySet),
}

enum MetadataResponseData {
    /// The metadata key list to be reported
    /// in response to the `KeySet` metadata query kind.
    KeySet(MetadataKeySet),

    /// The values of the keys that were specified in the
    /// `Values` variant of the metadata query kind.
    Values(MetadataMap),
}

trait UniqueAssetApi {
    /// Return the metadata of the provided Unique Asset.
    /// Can return either a metadata key set
    /// or metadata values for the specified keys. 
    fn query_metadata(
        // See the Identification Standard.
        asset: VersionedUniqueAsset,

        query_kind: MetadataQueryKind,
    ) -> Result<MetadataResponseData, XcmError>;

    /// Query the interior assets of the specified asset.
    /// E.g., the `asset` can be an NFT collection
    /// and the "interior assets" are NFTs within it.
    ///
    /// This method may return a portion of data.
    /// The result vector must be ordered such that
    /// a new data chunk can be retrieved starting from the last object.
    /// NOTE: when iterating, this method MUST be called on the same block,
    /// otherwise the results are unspecified.
    ///
    /// The second argument must be `None` on first call of this method.
    fn query_interior_assets(
        asset: VersionedUniqueAsset,
        iterate_from: Option<VersionedUniqueAsset>,
    ) -> Result<Vec<VersionedUniqueAsset>, XcmError>;
}
```

### Application-level Metadata Formats

The clients must interpret the metadata encoded in the transport-level format using the application-level formats. The chains must also honor the application-level formats, though only a few are mandatory.

Each application-level format must have a unique name and a set of keys, and their value types must be defined. The format must also explicitly define what keys are mutable and, if so, how they are supposed to be mutated.
Note that if a key is optional (or can be deleted if it exists), its type must be an `Option<T>`, where `T` can be substituted with any type in the key description.

The formats must be listed in this section. More application-level formats can be added in the future.

The format's name must prefix the keys corresponding to this format. For instance, `ownership:owner` defines the metadata key `owner` of the `ownership` application-level format.

#### Format: `supported`

This format is mandatory. All chains must implement it for all Unique Assets.

##### Fields

- `supported:formats`: a mandatory field containing a SCALE-encoded list of supported application-level formats for the given Unique Asset.
This key can only be mutated by a system chain operation, such as a Runtime Upgrade or a custom alternative privileged transaction.

##### Example

A client can always fetch the supported formats of a Unique Asset.

```js
// Fetches the supported application-level formats of collection #42 on Unique Network
query_metadata(
    {
        V4: {
            id: {
                parents: 0, interior: { X1: [{ GeneralIndex: 42 }] },
            },
            instance: 'Undefined',
        }
    },

    {
        Values: ["supported:formats"],
    }
)
```

The `query_metadata` from the example above must return at least the following:
```js
{
    "supported:formats": ["supported", "ownership"]
}
```

#### Format: `ownership`

This format is mandatory. All chains must implement it for all Unique Assets.

##### Fields

- `ownership:owner`: a mandatory field containing a SCALE-encoded `VersionedXcmLocation` representing the owner of the Unique Asset. The value's XCM version is determined by the Unique Asset's version supplied to the `query_metadata`.
A privileged operation can modify this key, but it must explicitly specify the change to this field.

##### Example

A client can always fetch the owner of a Unique Asset.

```js
// Fetches the owner of collection #42 on Unique Network
query_metadata(
    {
        V4: {
            id: {
                parents: 0, interior: { X1: [{ GeneralIndex: 42 }] },
            },
            instance: 'Undefined',
        }
    },

    {
        Values: ["ownership:owner"],
    }
)
```

The `query_metadata` from the example above might return the following:
```js
{
    "ownership:owner": {
        V4: {
            parents: 0,
            interior: {
                X1: [{ AccountId32: { id: "5EkPpFmJcVP4mN5mHLKZqkYUzkDWvjmjqs6t14m4rgndfEm8" } }]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
